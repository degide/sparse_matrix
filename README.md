# Sparse Matrix
A program for addition, subtraction and multiplication of sparse matrices.

## Usage
To perform supported operations on sparse matrices, run:
`node sparse_matrix <operation> <first_matrix_file_path> <second_matrix_file_path>`

The `<operation>` can be one of the following values:
1. `add`: This performs the addition between the two matrices
2. `subtract`: Performs the subtraction of the second matrix from the first matrix
3. `multiply`: This performs the multiplication of the two matrices.
